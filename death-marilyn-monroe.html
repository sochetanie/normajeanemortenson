    <h1>Death of Marilyn Monroe</h1>
    <p>
      On August 5, 1962, Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her home in Los Angeles. She was discovered lying nude on her bed, face down, with a telephone in one hand. Empty bottles of pills that were prescribed to treat her depression were littered around the room. After a brief investigation, Los Angeles police concluded that her death was "caused by a self-administered overdose of sedative drugs and that the mode of death is probable suicide."</p>

      In 1961, Monroe battled depression and was under the constant care of a psychiatrist. Increasingly erratic in the last months of her life, she lived as a virtual recluse in her Brentwood, Los Angeles home. After midnight on August 5, 1962, her maid, Eunice Murray, noticed Monroe's bedroom light on. When Murray found the door locked and Marilyn unresponsive to her calls, she called Monroe's psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson, who gained access to the room by breaking a window. Entering, he found Marilyn dead, and the police were called sometime after. An autopsy found a fatal amount of sedatives in her system which prompted the medical examiner to rule her death as probable suicide.

      Marilyn Monroe's death has received front-page coverage throughout the world. Gay Talese reported in The New York Times that the number of suicides in New York a week after her death hit a record high of 12 in one day. One suicide victim left a note saying, "If the most wonderful, beautiful thing in the world has nothing to live for, then neither must I." Truman Capote, writing from Spain, recorded in a letter, "Cannot believe that Marilyn M. is dead. She was such a good-hearted girl, so pure really, so much on the side of the angels. Poor little baby." Billy Wilder, while loudly complaining that it had been taxing to direct her in The Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot - two of her greatest and best-loved movies - recalled that it was "worth a week's torment to get ... three luminous minutes on the screen." In Italy, Sophia Loren broke down and wept. Joshua Logan, who directed Monroe in the film version of William Inge's Bus Stop, paid her the ultimate compliment when he compared the "dumb blonde" character she created to Chaplin's Tramp, one of the great comic inventions of the 20th century.

      The night Marilyn Monroe was found dead, it was stated as an accidental suicide. But what happened to the red diary that she wrote everything down in? It never left her side, yet the police reports show no evidence of it. Now over 30 years later, a man claims to have the red diary of Marilyn. In addition, he continued to keep his own diaries which gives his involvement with the Kennedys, The Mob, the CIA, and others. Now that he's on his deathbed, it's time to blow everything wide open.

    <h1>Conspiracy Theories</h1>
    <p>
      Monroe's death has been surrounded in controversy, and many of her fans and admirers believe that she was given the pills against her will. The investigation was quick and suspicious, and the official account of her death begs numerous unanswered questions. Why, for example, did it take Murray so long to call for help? What about the reports that Greenson summoned an ambulance and then turned it away after finding Marilyn dead? And how did a drinking glass, after the police search, turn up in Marilyn's room? Murray would later change her story several times over her life, and the first policeman on the scene, Jack Clemmons, said that "Her hands were by her side and her legs were stretched out perfectly straight. It was the most obviously staged death scene I had ever seen. The pill bottles on her bedside table had been arranged in neat order and the body deliberately positioned, it all looked too tidy." There have been numerous theories about what really happened to Marilyn Monroe, many of them placing the blame on the Kennedy brothers.

      One of the main conspiracy theories linked to Monroe's death was that she was in fact killed by the CIA. in Norman Mailer's best-selling book, Marilyn: A Biography, which was published in 1973 to great public attention. Mailer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist never shy of provoking controversy, repeated the link between Marilyn's death and the Kennedys. In his book, he expressed that to get back at the Kennedys for the disastrous Bay of Pigs fiasco, right-wing agents of the FBI or CIA killed Marilyn to upset the Kennedy brothers. He also claimed that Marilyn called the White House on the night of her death, and that the FBI confiscated her phone records. Mailer, however, didn't have a single shed of evidence to back up his claims, and later admitted he only wrote the book for money. To add up, it was rumored Marilyn had a romance with both of the Kennedy brothers hence the CIA act of vengeance on her.

      While Monroe garnered fame playing characters who matched the ditzy blonde stereotype, the actress was actually quite intellectual. She was an avid reader and maintained a personal library that included work by Ernest Hemingway, D.H. Lawrence, and James Joyce. "She played ditzy blondes and, for some reason, people believed that was the person she was, but that couldn't have been further from the truth," Michelle Morgan, author of Marilyn Monroe: Private and Undisclosed told The Telegraph.

      The novelist Truman Capote, a close friend of Monroe's, also spoke of her intelligence in a 1975 interview with Richard Zoerink for Playgirl magazine."Well, you know ... funny thing about Marilyn," Capote said, "she was really very, very shy, very insecure. But she was also very, very bright. People would humor her, thinking she was a dumb blonde; but Marilyn was very perceptive. She wasn't fooled by many people, and they thought they were fooling her all the time."

      Of the many gifts that Marilyn Monroe passed on to this world before her untimely death in 1962, the greatest was the gift of immortalized youth and untouched captivating beauty. Marilyn will never grow old, she'll never show a single wrinkle, her pictures will forever remain as flawless as everyone in her life needed her to be. The same need felt by people nowadays who can't find comfort in religion or the facts of life. Marilyn Monroe - because of her current standing in pop culture - has become a curse. A fate she would have never wanted for herself.
