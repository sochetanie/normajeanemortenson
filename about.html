                <p>According to The Guide to United States Popular Culture, "as an icon of American popular culture, Monroe's few rivals in popularity include Elvis Presley and Mickey Mouse ... no other star has ever inspired such a wide range of emotions - from lust to pity, from envy to remorse." The American Film Institute has named her the sixth greatest female screen legend in American film history, Smithsonian Institution included her on their list of "100 Most Significant Americans of All Time", and both Variety and VH1 have placed her in the top ten in their rankings of the greatest popular culture icons of the twentieth century.</p>

                <h2> Actress Marilyn Monroe was born as Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926 in Los Angeles, California.</h2>
                    <p>During her all-too-brief life, Marilyn Monroe overcame a difficult childhood to become one of the world's biggest and most enduring sex symbols. She never knew her father, and once thought Clark Gable to be her father - a story repeated often enough for a version of it to gain some currency. However, there's no evidence that Gable ever met or knew Monroe's mother, Gladys, who developed psychiatric problems and was eventually placed in a mental institution. As an adult, Monroe would maintain that one of her earliest memories was of her mother trying to smother her in her crib with a pillow. Monroe had a half-sister, to whom she was not close; they met only a half-dozen times. Growing up, Monroe spent much of her time in foster care and in an orphanage. In 1937, a family friend and her husband, Grace and Doc Goddard, took care of Monroe for a few years. The Goddards were paid $25 weekly by Monroe's mother to raise her. The couple was deeply religious and followed fundamentalist doctrines; among other prohibited activities, Monroe was not allowed to go to the movies. But when Doc's job was transferred in 1942 to the East Coast, the couple could not afford to bring Monroe with them. At 7 years old, Monroe returned to a life in foster homes, where she was on several occasions sexually assaulted; she later said that she had been raped when she was 11 years old. But she had one way out - get married. She wed her boyfriend Jimmy Dougherty on June 19, 1942, at the age of 16. By that time, Monroe had dropped out of high school (age 15). A merchant marine, Dougherty was later sent to the South Pacific. Monroe went to work in a munitions factory in Van Nuys, California, where she was discovered by a photographer. By the time Dougherty returned in 1946, Monroe had a successful career as a model, and had changed her name to Marilyn Monroe in preparation for an acting career. She dreamt of becoming an actress like Jean Harlow and Lana Turne</p>
                <h2>"Being a sex symbol is a heavy load to carry, especially when one is tired, hurt and bewildered."</h2>
                    <p>With her breathy voice and hourglass figure, Monroe became a much-admired international star, despite her chronic insecurities regarding her acting abilities. Monroe suffered from pre-performance anxiety that sometimes made her physically ill and was often the root cause of her legendary tardiness on films sets, which was so extreme that it often infuriated her co-stars and crew. "She would be the greatest if she ran like a watch," director Billy Wilder once said of her. "I have an aunt Minnie who's very punctual, but who would pay to see Aunt Minnie?" Throughout her career, Monroe was signed and released from several contracts with film studios.</p>
                 <h2>"A career is wonderful, but you can't curl up with it on a cold night."</h2>
                    <p>Hollywood beauty Marilyn Monroe had countless lovers - but none of them stuck around long.</p>
                        <br><br>
                    <p>Monroe was divorced three times.</p>
                        <br><br>
                    <p>Shortly after the moniker became her real name, a young Norma Jean Baker married her neighbor James Dougherty at the tender age of 16.</p>
                        <br><br>
                    <p>Monroe went on to wed playwright Arthur Miller 8 years after calling it quits with DiMaggio, who she became close friends with once again after separating from Miller.And after each failed marriage Monroe said she would rather be miserable on her own than in tumultuous relationships. "It's better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone," she said.</p>
                <h2>The three ex-husbands were far from the only men in Monroe's life.</h2>
